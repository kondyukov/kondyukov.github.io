	<h2> Greetings! </h2>
	<p> <img src="./assets/me.jpg" alt="After a trans-atlantic flight." width="270"  align="right">  
	This is the personal webpage for Greg Kondyukov. I'm a recent university graduate looking to either 
	continue my academic education or gain experience in professional software development.</p>
	
	<p>My research interests are focused around computational physics and mathematical modeling.
	Specifically in non-linear systems, cosmology, general relativity, and many-body problems.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
	<p>Currently I am pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science at Florida State
	University, with coursework concentrating in Machine Learning and ancilliary exposure to Cybersecurity. </p>
	
	<p>At Florida State University I received a dual degree in Physics and 
	in Applied and Computational Mathematics. For Physics I was given Honors
	in the Major for completing an honors thesis in computational nuclear 
	physics under the advisement of <a href="http://www.volya.net">Dr. Alexander Volya.</a></p>
	
	<p>Beside physics and mathematics study, I also took a large breadth of 
	computer science courses which were mainly taught in C++. From the coursework
	I have a thorough understanding of object-oriented database programming, 
	algorithms, and low-level programming. </p>

<h2>Research and Experience</h2>
	<p>Currently I am a fresh addition to Dr. Sonia Haiduc's reasearch group at the Department of
	Computer Science. The group's research focus is in Software Engineering, specifically looking
	into document tracibility and machine learning applications. My involvement is currently focused
	on using Natural Language Processing to classify user submitted reports in Bug Tracking Systems.</p>
	
	<p>From May 2014 to December 2015 I conducted reseach under Dr. Alexander 
	Volya that I used to develop my <a href="http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu%3A270354">honors thesis</a> 
	which was successfully defended in May 2015. However, I decided to stay at
	the university for an additional semester during which time I expanded upon
	the original work by developing methods for complex resonance calculations.</p>
	
	<p>From August 2012 to May 2014 I was employed at the FSU <a href="http://physics.fsu.edu">Department of Physics</a>
	via the Federal Work-Study program. During this time I worked in developing 
	automation software for scientific equipment, process control mechanisms for 
	National Instruments equipment, and FPGAs.
	
	<p> Here's a link to my <a href="./assets/Kondyukov_CV_2016.pdf">CV</a>.
<h2>Outreach</h2>
	<p> For the 2014-2015 academic year I was the Vice President of the 
	Florida State University chapter of the Society of Physics Students. 
	Along with my collegues, I worked to build and maintain a community for 
	undergraduates interested in physics. We also gave talks at local 
	events for people of all ages to help develop an interest in science.</p>
		
	<p> In addition to working on research, I spent every summer at Florida 
	State Univeristy mentoring incoming physics students.</p>

	<h2> What is wumbo? </h2>
	
	<p> Wumbo is a nonsense word from the show about everybody's
		favourite animated sea sponge. For your education, here's 
		the inception of the eponymous word itself.</p>

	<h2> But why wumbo? </h2>
	
	<p> It made for a short, catchy, and (most importantly) available
		domain name. Normally I have a home server connected to this

		of things.</p>
